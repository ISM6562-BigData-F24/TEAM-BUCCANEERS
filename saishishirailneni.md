Hi, my name is Sai Shishir Ailneni. I have a strong background in data modeling, machine learning, and Python programming, with a growing interest in MLOps, data engineering, and big data.

Currently, I'm exploring certifications and courses in data engineering, while also working as a Machine Learning Intern with Hit Promotional Products. In my free time, I enjoy watching and analyzing sports, particularly football and cricket, where I love following team strategies and player performances.
