# Prudhvi Mamidi

I am Prudhvi, originally from India, with a strong foundation in business intelligence and analytics. I completed my undergraduate studies followed by an MBA, which fueled my passion for integrating technology with business strategy. I have three years of experience as a Business Intelligence Consultant, where I specialized in database integration and developed insightful business intelligence reports and dashboards using tools like Data Proc, Data Bricks, Snowflake, and Tableau.
My keen interest in the intersection of technology and business led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at the University of South Florida (USF). I am driven by the potential to leverage advanced analytics and technology to drive business success. Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy reading books and watching sci-fi movies, which continually inspire my forward-thinking approach.
